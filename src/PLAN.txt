PLAN

TODO:

0) ghost of target in middle to align when cutting
1) grid for cut end while moving
2) tetris like arrows (holding shift make edges stick to each other)



00) make crate!


2) make tutorial section (Simplicity)
3) make Convexity section 
5) match pairs of animal polygons and try to map them to each other


VIEW TODO:
    1) rounded edges 
    2) make visuals bigger than model by epsilon (leeway for collisions)
    3) remove the pull back to previous position when colliding with target 
        should just play sound and bounce horizontally quickly
    4) Wood texture for polygons

POLISHING

    Make a better rounded look: at every point, but a bezier curve to round off the edges
    ----limit the area of a new polygon after a cut (cannot make a new polygon that is
        too small)

    add shadows to the edges of the polygons

    make neuromorphic design for shapeshifted area. Send position of polygon points to gpu,
    and use a polygon SDF. Make Corners rounded.
            Make shaders for each theme.
            Make contours for each theme.

    System that helps player to place polygon as tightly as possible inside the target
            player presses an arrow key and the polygon translates as far as possible in that direction
            ctrl plus arrow rotates as much as possible

    Upon win, extend the target area so that it becomes the whole play area

    When cutting, if two points are too close to each other, merge them




WASM

    Remove inspector from wasm build
