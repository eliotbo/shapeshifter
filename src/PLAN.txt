PLAN

TODO:
000) make polygon maker plugin (easily removable from final game)
001) add grid to cursor
002) save/load mesh with popup window
003) rotate by 180 + rotate min angle should be a factor of 90 degrees

00) make crate!

1) add possibility to move points
2) make tutorial section (Simplicity)
3) make Convexity section 
4) make lots of animal polygons 
5) match pairs of animal polygons and try to map them to each other


VIEW TODO:
    1) rounded edges 
    2) make visuals bigger than model by epsilon (leeway for collisions)
    3) remove the pull back to previous position when colliding with target 
        should just play sound and bounce horizontally quickly
    4) Wood texture for polygons

POLISHING

    Make a better rounded look: at every point, but a bezier curve to round off the edges
    ----limit the area of a new polygon after a cut (cannot make a new polygon that is
        too small)

    add shadows to the edges of the polygons

    make neuromorphic design for shapeshifted area. Send position of polygon points to gpu,
    and use a polygon SDF. Make Corners rounded.
            Make shaders for each theme.
            Make contours for each theme.




WASM

    Remove inspector from wasm build
