PLAN

TODO:
1) make the shapeshifted area 
2) make the take back animation when two shapes are overlapping
    need previous transform in meta information



GIT commands

create new repo online from local repo
    gh repo create
    git push --set-upstream origin main


IDEA




Worlds in order of difficulty
0) Simplicity 
1) Convexity
2) Perplexity
3) Complexity


Write the section titles with low poly font


Each section has its own theme
0) Wood
1) Metal
2) Stone 
3) Glass

Level:
look at origami
chocolate bar


POLISHING

Make a better rounded look: at every point, but a bezier curve to round off the edges
----limit the area of a new polygon after a cut (cannot make a new polygon that is
    too small)

add shadows to the edges of the polygons

make neuromorphic design for shapeshifted area. Send position of polygon points to gpu,
and use a polygon SDF. Make Corners rounded.
        Make shaders for each theme
