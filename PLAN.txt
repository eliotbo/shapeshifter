IDEAs






POLISHING

    yellow poly outside of target, green inside

    on startup, show splash and cut the polygon letters

    Make a better rounded look: at every point, but a bezier curve to round off the edges
    ----limit the area of a new polygon after a cut (cannot make a new polygon that is
        too small)




    System that helps player to place polygon as tightly as possible inside the target
            player presses an arrow key and the polygon translates as far as possible in that direction
            ctrl plus arrow rotates as much as possible



 


    remove the pull back to previous position when colliding with target 
        should just play sound and bounce horizontally quickly

    Wood texture for polygons

    optimization: import part of lyon (algorithms, path)




WASM

    Remove inspector from wasm build
