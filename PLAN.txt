IDEAs






POLISHING

    yellow poly outside of target, green inside

    on startup, show splash and cut the polygon letters


    System that helps player to place polygon as tightly as possible inside the target
            player presses an arrow key and the polygon translates as far as possible in that direction
            ctrl plus arrow rotates as much as possible

    optimization: import part of lyon (algorithms, path)
